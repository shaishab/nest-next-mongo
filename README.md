# NEST-NEXT-MONGO AGGREGATED EXAMPLE

This is a monorepo skeleton build with Nest.js (Node), Next.js (React) and Mongoose (MongoDB) with server side rendering. This skeleton demonstrates how to use nest-next-mongoDB together with server side rendering to [nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) with [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).

All needed components are expected to be under one project, one repo, with this folder being the root of the repository.
